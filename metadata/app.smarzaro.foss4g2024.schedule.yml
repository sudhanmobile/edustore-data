  <b>About FOSS4G</b>
  FOSS4G is the acronym for Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial. It is the annual recurring global event hosted by OSGeo, the non-profit organization that supports and promotes the collaborative development of free and open source geographic technologies and open geospatial data.

  The conference covers all kinds of topics related to geospatial information and earth observation openness from Software development to Transition to FOSS4G, Use cases and applications, Education and research and Open data.

  This event is for all kinds of people interested in sharing experiences about maps, from developers who write code to users of geomatics software, people who make decisions, researchers, students and anyone who wants to learn, share and meet like GIS interested people.

  It attracts over 1,000 practitioners and advocates for free and open source software for geospatial and the tendency is to increase this number every year. It is the main meeting place and educational outreach opportunity for OSGeo members, supporters and newcomers - to share and learn from one another in presentations, hands-on workshops and a conference exhibition.
