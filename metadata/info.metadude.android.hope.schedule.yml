Description: |
  Program app for the HOPE XV conference (2024)

  https://hope.net

  H.O.P.E. stands for Hackers On Planet Earth, one of
  the most creative and diverse hacker events in the
  world. It's been happening since 1994.

  Thousands of people from around the world come to
  HOPE. Join us for three full days and nights of
  activities, including provocative and enlightening
  speakers that the HOPE conferences are known for.
  The conference is in-person on the St. John's
  University campus in Queens, New York City. Many
  sessions will also be available online.

  Past HOPE events have featured fascinating talks,
  inspirational keynotes, and workshops on every topic
  from lockpicking to getting a ham radio license to
  analyzing Android malware. HOPE has showcased new
  movies, had cool live performances, done live radio
  broadcasts, and much, much more. Past speakers
  include Steve Wozniak, Jello Biafra, and Edward
  Snowden.
