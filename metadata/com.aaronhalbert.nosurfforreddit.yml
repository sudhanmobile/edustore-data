AutoName: NoSurf for reddit
Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b>Can no longer connect to Reddit.

  "NoSurf for reddit" is the world's first non-addictive Reddit client.

  Here's what it does:
  * Lets you browse ONLY the first page of /r/all
  * Lets you browse ONLY the first page of your subscribed subreddits
  * Lets you read ONLY the top 3 parent comments on each post
  * Grays and X's out posts you've already read

  ...and that's it. No more endless scrolling. No more mindless surfing. No more finding yourself on page 89 of /r/all at 3am.

  Take control now by deleting your current Reddit app and installing NoSurf for reddit. Do it now.

  Includes Night Mode and AMOLED Night Mode.

  NoSurf for reddit is free, ad-free, libre, and privacy-centric, and always will be. It will not drain your battery, slow down your phone, or read your personal data in any way. No special permissions required.
