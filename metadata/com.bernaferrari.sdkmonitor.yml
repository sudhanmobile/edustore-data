AutoName: SDK Monitor
Description: |-
  This app tracks changes on targetSDK from your apps. Starting November 1st,
  2018, Google is requiring all app updates to target at least 26 (28 is the
  latest).

  The idea behind this project was to make it easy to see the apps which are
  "voluntarily" being updated regularly, and the ones that are resisting
  until the last second.
